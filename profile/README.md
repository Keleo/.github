## Hey, this is Keleo - the company behind Kimai 👋

We’ve been doing this since **2017**. That's when we made our first commit to [Kimai](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2). We are happy to know that we are helping thousands of companies and freelancers across the 🌎 with their (project) time-tracking workflows.

### Our philosophy

The open source community is the 💗 heart of Kimai and fundamental to how we build software today.

We love open source, benefit from open source, sponsor open source, create and contribute to open source. You could say we live and breathe open source daily.

### Our open source plugins

Some plugins were created because we think they are useful for every Kimai user.
And some plugins were created on customer behalf, thus sponsored for the benefit of the entire community. Thank you 🙏
